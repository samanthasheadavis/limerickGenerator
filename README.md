# Limerick Generator

Build your own limericks! For this project I used the [datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/) in a single-page app built with AngularJS to plug rhymes into a schema for a limerick.

User inputs nouns, verbs and adjectives to build the limerick in a step-by-step flow built with a simple function utilizing ng-show and ng-hide to progress between steps.
